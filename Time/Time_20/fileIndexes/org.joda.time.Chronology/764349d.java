/**
 * Chronology provides access to the individual date time fields for a
 * chronological calendar system.
 * <p>
 * Various chronologies are supported by subclasses including ISO and GregorianJulian.
 * This class provides static factory methods to access these chronologies.
 * For example, to obtain the current time in the coptic calendar system:
 * <pre>
 * DateTime dt = new DateTime(Chronology.getCoptic());
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * The provided chronology implementations are:
 * <ul>
 * <li>ISO - Based on the ISO8601 standard and suitable for use after about 1600
 * <li>GJ - Historically accurate calendar with Julian followed by Gregorian
 * <li>Gregorian - The Gregorian calendar system used for all time (proleptic)
 * <li>Julian - The Julian calendar system used for all time (proleptic)
 * <li>Buddhist - The Buddhist calendar system which is an offset in years from GJ
 * <li>Coptic - The Coptic calendar system which defines 30 day months
 * </ul>
 * Hopefully future releases will contain more chronologies.
 * <p>
 * This class defines a number of fields with names from the ISO8601 standard.
 * It does not 'strongly' define these fields however, thus implementations
 * are free to interpret the field names as they wish.
 * For example, a week could be defined as 10 days and a month as 40 days in a
 * special WeirdChronology implementation. Clearly the GJ and ISO
 * implementations provided use the field names as you would expect.
