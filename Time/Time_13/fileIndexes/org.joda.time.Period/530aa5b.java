/**
 * An immutable time period specifying a set of duration field values.
 * <p>
 * A time period is divided into a number of fields, such as hours and seconds.
 * Which fields are supported is defined by the PeriodType class.
 * <p>
 * When this time period is added to an instant, the effect is of adding each field in turn.
 * As a result, this takes into account daylight savings time.
 * Adding a time period of 1 day to the day before daylight savings starts will only add
 * 23 hours rather than 24 to ensure that the time remains the same.
 * If this is not the behaviour you want, then see {@link Duration}.
 * <p>
 * Period is thread-safe and immutable, provided that the PeriodType is as well.
 * All standard PeriodType classes supplied are thread-safe and immutable.
