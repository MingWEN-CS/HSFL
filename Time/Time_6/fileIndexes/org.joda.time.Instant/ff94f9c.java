/**
 * Instant is the standard implementation of a fully immutable instant in time.
 * It holds the instant as milliseconds from the Java Epoch of 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z.
 * <p>
 * The chronology used is always ISO in the UTC time zone.
 * This corresponds to the definition of the Java Epoch.
 * <p>
 * An Instant can be used to compare two <code>DateTime</code> objects:
 * <pre>
 * boolean sameInstant = dt1.toInstant().equals(dt2.toInstant());
 * </pre>
 * This code will return true if the two <code>DateTime</code> objects represent
 * the same instant regardless of chronology or time zone.
 * <p>
 * Note that the following code will also perform the same check:
 * <pre>
 * boolean sameInstant = dt1.isEqual(dt2);
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * Instant is thread-safe and immutable.
