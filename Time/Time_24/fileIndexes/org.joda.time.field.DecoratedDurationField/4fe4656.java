/**
 * <code>DecoratedDurationField</code> extends {@link BaseDurationField},

 * methods delegate to a wrapped field.
 * <p>
 * This design allows new DurationField types to be defined that piggyback on
 * top of another, inheriting all the safe method implementations from
 * BaseDurationField. Should any method require pure delegation to the
 * wrapped field, simply override and use the provided getWrappedField method.
 * <p>
 * DecoratedDurationField is thread-safe and immutable, and its subclasses must
 * be as well.
