 * Abstract datetime field class that defines its own DurationField, which

 * <p>
 * This DateTimeField is useful for defining DateTimeFields that are composed
 * of imprecise durations. If both duration fields are precise, then a
 * {@link PreciseDateTimeField} should be used instead.
 * <p>
 * When defining imprecise DateTimeFields where a matching DurationField is
 * already available, just extend BaseDateTimeField directly so as not to
 * create redundant DurationField instances.
 * <p>
 * ImpreciseDateTimeField is thread-safe and immutable, and its subclasses must
 * be as well.
