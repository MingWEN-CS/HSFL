            Reduce the memory cost of generating source maps by reducing the number
            of property structure objects that are created.  We do this by taking
            advantage of the fact the property list objects are immutable and can be
            shared between Nodes.  The source file prop is then shared between
            every Node in the AST for a given source file, reducing the the number
            of property nodes used to store this information from O(ast-nodes) to
            O(source-files).

            SanityCheck is upset because large numbers cause non-determinism

            First pass on refactoring FoldConstants into separate peephole optimizations. This changelist adds the notion of an AbstractPeepholeOptimization and adds a PeepholeOptimizationsPass that runs them. In this go around the minimization aspects of FoldConstants have been factored out into PeepholeMinimize. A future change will factor out the other components of FoldConstants into their own PeepholeOptimizations. DefaultPassConfig has also been updated to run the new PeepholeOptimizationPass.
    
            This change does not move the minimization-related unit tests from FoldConstantsTest to PeepholeMinimizeTest -- a future, separate, change will do so. Hopefully this will make it easier to review.

            i *think* this is the right behavior, because it more closely
            maps to how we infer "this" types in type-checking, but there
            may be cases i haven't thought of.

            "Anonymous function" is a confusing term for functions with names.

            Various delegate fixes.
    
            Give the delegate proxy a name unique from the delegate base so that
            InstanceObjectType#equals distinguishes them. This is necessary for
            AmbiguateProperties to work.
    
            Fix the prototype of the delegate proxy. This makes
            DisambiguateProperties continue to work.
    
            Add superclass methods of the delegate base to the delegate proxy.

            Here is a crazy thought, let's not require the JSTypeRegistry during
            parsing.
    
            There are basically two changes here:
            1) The IRFactory was looking for enums to seed the JSTypeRegistry, so
            we do that when we setup for type interence.
            2) The JSDocParser was checking the types of @defines objects, now do
            that during ProcessDefines.

            In AmbiguateProperties, invert the related type relationship, by
            considering subclasses and implementors (down) instead of superclasses
            and implemented interfaces (up). This has two advantages:
    
            - The 'independent of' relationship is simplified, because we only
              need to consider whether the related types intersect.
    
            - We can account for 'multiple inheritance', which is a practical
              issue because of interfaces.
    
            Note that the 'up' relationship allows us to easily find common
            ancestors while the 'down' relationship allows us to easily find
            common descendants -- and this is what we care about for ambiguation.

    The MethodCompilerPass was being a little too smart for itself, leading
    to incorrect behavior by the InlineGetter pass (inlining extern
    definitions of functions which it thought were empty functions). This
    results in slight worse behavior by the depreciated "MethodCheck" pass,
    but most projects have moved on to "check_types" which is on by default. (John)

    Change the default pretty printer so that then clauses of if

    Fix DisambiguateProperties whenever an inferface was unioned with

    twice--once to get the alternates of the union and once to
    get the interface implementations--and the related type would not
    get passed up the recursion stack. (Nick)
