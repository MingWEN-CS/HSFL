            Use a new heuristic for CheckGlobalThis.
            Fixes closure-compiler issue 144.
            i *think* this is the right behavior, because it more closely
            maps to how we infer "this" types in type-checking, but there
            may be cases i haven't thought of.

            As it turns out, order matters. When we resolve an @override function,
            we need to be able to find the function that it overrides.

            Replace {@inheritDoc} javadoc annotation with @Override.
            @Override is better as it implies documentation inheritance plus checks

            Here is a crazy thought, let's not require the JSTypeRegistry during
            parsing.
    
            There are basically two changes here:
            1) The IRFactory was looking for enums to seed the JSTypeRegistry, so
            we do that when we setup for type interence.
            2) The JSDocParser was checking the types of @defines objects, now do
            that during ProcessDefines.

            In AmbiguateProperties, invert the related type relationship, by
            considering subclasses and implementors (down) instead of superclasses
            and implemented interfaces (up). This has two advantages:
    
            - The 'independent of' relationship is simplified, because we only
              need to consider whether the related types intersect.
    
            - We can account for 'multiple inheritance', which is a practical
              issue because of interfaces.
    
            Note that the 'up' relationship allows us to easily find common
            ancestors while the 'down' relationship allows us to easily find
            common descendants -- and this is what we care about for ambiguation.

    The MethodCompilerPass was being a little too smart for itself, leading
    to incorrect behavior by the InlineGetter pass (inlining extern
    definitions of functions which it thought were empty functions). This
    results in slight worse behavior by the depreciated "MethodCheck" pass,
    but most projects have moved on to "check_types" which is on by default. (John)
